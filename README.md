# SQL

This project contains some commonly used SQL queries developed by me on my previous job. I've changed the name of some variables and table IDs for privacy reasons.

These queries are useful for analyzing and retrieving data from large datasets.

The first query analyzes the processing size of queries and returns the query, count of queries, and the sum of the total bytes processed by it.

The second query analyzes the results of an A/B experiment and returns the parameters of interest.

The third query analyzes the origin of the web traffic and returns valuable information about user aquisition.

The fourth query retrieves results for page views outside of Brazil and in a recipe that was translated for a different language, it was a way to count our accesses by non Brazilian users .
